# Titanic-Disaster-Analysis-Predicting-Survival-with-ML
Welcome to my Github repository. This is my another new project is Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning from Scratch This project focuses on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic dataset using machine learning techniques. The model is trained with 240 epochs, achieving a training accuracy of 0.8638 and a test accuracy of 0.8212. 


Project Highlights
✔️ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical features.
✔️ Exploring Data Splitting Techniques – Implementing various approaches to optimize model performance.
✔️ Machine Learning Models – Experimenting with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
✔️ Elastic Data Handling – Introducing a flexible approach to preprocessing for better adaptability.
✔️ Performance Evaluation – Assessing model accuracy, loss, and generalization.


Results
Training Accuracy: 0.8638
Test Accuracy: 0.8212
